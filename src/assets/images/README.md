# Image Assets

This folder contains image assets used in the React components.

## Usage

Import images in your React components:

```javascript
import toyotaLogo from '../assets/images/toyota-logo.svg';
import heroBackground from '../assets/images/hero-bg.jpg';
```

## Organization

- **logos/**: Brand logos and marks
- **backgrounds/**: Background images for sections
- **vehicles/**: Vehicle photos and showcases
- **icons/**: UI icons and graphics
- **ui/**: UI-specific images and graphics

## Best Practices

1. **Optimize for web**: Compress images before adding
2. **Use appropriate formats**: 
   - SVG for logos and icons
   - WebP/JPEG for photos
   - PNG for images with transparency
3. **Responsive images**: Consider multiple sizes for different screen densities
4. **Descriptive names**: Use clear, descriptive filenames
5. **Alt text**: Always provide alt text for accessibility
